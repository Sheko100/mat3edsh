# Goals and vision

To support all the features that [PyPDF2](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.0/) providing like **cropping,** **merging**, **reducing size**, **transforming**, **encrypting**, etc...

To build a **suite** of those features that serves one goal as a one feature, and maybe someday we manage to build a **graphical user interface** for it.
